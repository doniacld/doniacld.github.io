They are CNCF ambassadors, Docker captains, or AWS heroes. The **women in tech are the game-changers of cloud-native development**, sharing their knowledge about containers, Kubernetes, Docker, or DevOps topics. They inspire the new generation of girls entering into the STEM universe.

Diversity is crucial in a successful company by bringing different perspectives to solve a problem, understand all customers and overall coming up with the right solutions to challenges.   
We find many organizations preaching the importance of having female figures to identify and inspire young girls (meaning less than 18 yo) to venture into tech paths.  

I might still be a young girl.  Or it may be important, at any age, to have role models. I will flow with the second option.  

**In this article, I will cover the importance of having inspirational females and reveal my top 5 motivational speakers of the year: the women in cloud.**

## Why it is important to have role models

Since I was young, I have always had people, alive or dead, inspiring me, to create, to follow a path, or to be a better person.

Today, I want to progress in cloud application development, Golang, and to contribute more to open-source projects.  
Naturally, when I look at women in these areas, teaching, sharing their knowledge in every possible form, it makes me realize I want to be one of them.

I have **dreams and ambitions.**

That’s a great thing to **have dreams but making them happen, is a better thing.** Here is my strategy.

By observing these women one can **identify concrete objectives** and break them down into small achievable pieces (SMART method, does it ring a bell ?).

**Prepare your learning plan.**

Women speakers publish content every day in the form of articles, tutorials, books, videos, podcasts, demos, to mention just a few.  You can find a plethora of media to **learn from 
them** about their areas of expertise. Of course, women like these possess notable soft skills such as public speaking, writing, and educational talents.

As a matter of fact, these ladies are cloud-native leaders. By showing what they achieve,
**they motivate me into getting the best out of myself.**
