Episode 193 of the eBPF & Cilium Office Hours live stream (eCHO).

## About the Episode

Who's really eating your CPU? Security agents are often in the spotlight, but Henrik Rexed's benchmarks uncover that eBPF itself comes with a price tag.

In this episode, I host Henrik Rexed (CNCF Ambassador and Cloud Native Advocate at Dynatrace) for a deep dive into the real cost of visibility and security in modern systems.

### Topics Covered

- Runtime security agent benchmarks (Falco, Tetragon, KubeArmor, Kubescape)
- eBPF performance impact and CPU footprint
- How to measure and compare security solutions
- Best practices for security observability
