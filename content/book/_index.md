## What Go experts are saying

<div class="book-quotes">
  <blockquote class="book-quote">
    <p>"I love learning theory, but I always learn infinitely more when I build something real. Aliénor, Donia and Pascal's fantastic book takes you through the Go programming language with real-world projects and problems that are interesting, relevant, and perhaps most importantly, fun. I wish this existed when I was learning Go."</p>

    <p>"I first fell in love with this book in early 2023 when I read the first four chapters. Now that it's complete, there's even more to love: The conversational style that feels like a personal guide through the Go language, the fact that testing is treated as a first-class concern, and the detailed, non-threatening explanations of important topics."</p>
