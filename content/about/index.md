Hi,  

My name is Donia Chaiehloudj. I am a software developer living and working in the south of France. 
I am Golang and open-source enthusiast striving to share my knowledge with others. 
I am a Google Developer Group organiser, Women Techmaker ambassador and part of a women in tech organisation called [WHAT06](https://what06.fr/).

When I am AFK, I enjoy dancing, sewing and hiking!
