# Code contributions

Since Hacktoberfest 2021, I began to contribute to open source projects:
- [revive](https://github.com/mgechev/revive): a linter for Go
- [tinygo drivers](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers): tinygo is a Go compiler for microcontrollers
- [tinygo badge](https://github.com/tinygo-org/gobadge): Run tinygo programs on an Adafruit board

# Events organisation

I founded in 2022 a local chapter of Google Developer Group to organise tech events. We are now a team of 4 people running remote and in-person events with the tech community.
You can find the past and coming events on the [GDG Sophia-Antipolis page](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-sophia-antipolis/) and the remote hosted events on YouTube:
