I founded the Google Developer Group Sophia-Antipolis chapter in March 2022 to organize tech events and build a developer community in the south of France.

## Impact

Since the creation of the chapter, we have organized **30+ events** including monthly meetups and annual conferences.

## DevFest Sophia-Antipolis

DevFest is our flagship annual conference, and it has grown significantly each year:

| Year | Attendees | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **2022** | 40 | First edition |
| **2023** | 70 | Growing community |
| **2024** | 150 | Record attendance |
| **2025** | 100 | Heavy rain didn't stop us! |

## What We Do

- **Monthly tech talks**: Online and in-person events covering various tech topics
- **Annual DevFest conference**: Full-day tech conference with multiple tracks
- **Community building**: Creating a space for developers to connect, learn, and share
- **Diversity & inclusion**: Promoting diversity in tech and welcoming everyone

## The Team

We are now a team of dedicated organizers running regular events. Our ambition is humble: building a community of tech people that lift others and create technical and human emulation with no ego.
