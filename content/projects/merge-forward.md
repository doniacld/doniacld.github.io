## About Merge Forward

I joined the [Merge Forward](https://community.cncf.io/merge-forward/) initiative in October 2025. Merge Forward is a CNCF community-driven initiative and home to seven diversity groups. Its mission is to build supportive networks and safe spaces for communities from diverse backgrounds and their allies.

## My Role

I lead onsite KubeCon activities, especially for kiosk participants, under the umbrella of the diverse community. This involves coordinating activities that welcome and support underrepresented groups into open source.

## Media

I did an interview for [TechStrong TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmvvKN7fDhU) representing the initiative and discussing how we're working to make open source more inclusive.

## Join the Community

Interested in joining? The OSS ecosystem faces a severe human deficit and welcoming underrepresented groups is critically important for the future of our ecosystem.
