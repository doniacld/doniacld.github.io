Presented at GopherCon US 2022, the largest Go conference in the United States.

## Abstract

TinyGo is a Go compiler for small places - microcontrollers, WebAssembly, and more. In this talk, I share my journey of using TinyGo to build a practical IoT project: monitoring my hen house.

You'll learn:
- What TinyGo is and how it differs from standard Go
- How to work with sensors and microcontrollers
- Building a complete monitoring solution with Prometheus and Grafana
