## Abstract

Transitioning from a monolithic architecture to microservices can be challenging. In this talk, I share practical advice and lessons learned from real-world experience:

- When microservices make sense (and when they don't)
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Best practices for Go microservices
- Tools and patterns that help
