- **Segmentation**: Granular security policies to isolate workloads
- **Multi-cloud/Multi-cluster**: Connecting Kubernetes clusters across environments
- **Security**: Safe harbor for critical infrastructure

## Key Stats from the Talk

- **95%** of Cilium users run multiple Kubernetes clusters
- **161** organizations publicly listed as Cilium adopters
- **912** contributors to the Cilium project on GitHub

## The People Behind Cilium

- Open source contributors building and adding to the hive
- CNCF ecosystem with certifications like CCNI
