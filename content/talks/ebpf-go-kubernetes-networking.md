Understanding the foundations of modern Kubernetes networking through eBPF and Go.

## Abstract

Modern Kubernetes networking solutions like Cilium are built on eBPF and Go. This talk explores:

- How eBPF revolutionizes networking in Kubernetes
- The role of Go in building eBPF-based tools
- Cilium architecture and how it leverages eBPF
- Practical examples and demonstrations
