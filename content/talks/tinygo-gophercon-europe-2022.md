My first major conference talk, presented at GopherCon Europe 2022 in Berlin. This was an amazing and transformative experience that marked the beginning of my public speaking journey.

## Abstract

TinyGo is a Go compiler for small places - microcontrollers, WebAssembly, and more. In this talk, I share my journey of using TinyGo to build a practical IoT project: monitoring my hen house.

You'll learn:
- What TinyGo is and how it differs from standard Go
- How to work with sensors and microcontrollers  
- Building a complete monitoring solution with Prometheus and Grafana

## The Story Behind

I was introduced by Ron Evans and Daniel Esteban, the TinyGo community's big names. Mat Ryer was co-hosting the event. Despite being very nervous, I managed to deliver the talk and even made some jokes that made people laugh!
