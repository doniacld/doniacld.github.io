A magical journey into the Linux kernel using eBPF as our lamp.

## Abstract

Like Aladdin's lamp, eBPF grants wishes in the kernel. This talk takes you on a journey through:

- The magic of eBPF and how it works
- Exploring kernel internals safely
- Building observability and networking solutions
- Practical examples and live demos
