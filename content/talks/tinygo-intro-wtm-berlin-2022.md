My first ever tech talk! This was a great first step into public speaking, delivered remotely for the Women Techmakers Berlin community.

## Abstract

An introduction to TinyGo for those who are new to the world of microcontrollers and embedded systems. This talk covers:

- What is TinyGo?
- How does it differ from standard Go?
- Getting started with your first TinyGo project
- Real-world use cases

## Background

This talk was the result of my participation in the Women Developer Academy program, where I learned how to build confidence, write abstracts, and make technical presentations.
