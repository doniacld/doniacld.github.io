Hi, My name is Donia Chaiehloudj. I am a software developer living and working in the south of France. I am cloud and open-source enthusiast and develop in my professional environment in Golang.  

My roles have ranged from QA to back-end developer, and I strive to become some day a developer advocate. 


When I am AFK, I enjoy dancing, sewing and hiking!

Find me online [@DoniaChaiehloudj](https://linkedin.com/in/donia-chaiehloudj).
